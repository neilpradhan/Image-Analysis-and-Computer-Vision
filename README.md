# Image-Analysis-and-Computer-Vision
Implementation of the state of art techniques for Image analysis as well as deducing conclusions of various esentially experimentation to improve understanding of Images

In this repository, I have implemented several algorithms that are important to know which are widely known as the basics of Computervision. Each lab has been described with the task achieved.Ofcourse these are only collections of state of art techniques, however my own experimentation is also presented as a part of assignment.

Lab 1  tasks achieved :  Elementary Image operations, Displaying grey scale images and playing with image matrix, Grey level Transformations,  Image Enhancement techniques such as logarithmic compresssion,Histogram Equalization and manipulation of colour tables. All kinds of state of art Filtering techniques and Fourier Transform Analysis.
