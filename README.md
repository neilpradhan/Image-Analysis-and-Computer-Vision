Implementation of the state of art techniques for Image analysis as well as deducing conclusions of various esentially experimentation to improve understanding of Images

In this repository, I have implemented several algorithms that are important to know which are widely known as the basics of Computervision. Each lab has been described with the task achieved.Ofcourse these are only collections of state of art techniques, however my own experimentation is also presented as a part of assignment.

Lab 1  tasks achieved :  Elementary Image operations, Displaying grey scale images and playing with image matrix, Grey level Transformations,  Image Enhancement techniques such as logarithmic compresssion,Histogram Equalization and manipulation of colour tables. All kinds of state of art Filtering techniques and Fourier Transform Analysis.

Lab 2  tasks achieved : Differential Geometric based Edge detection and edge detection using other operators such as Sobel,Prewitt are performed. Edge segments are extracted using derivative formula and thresholding experiments are made for different images.  In the end, complete code for Hough Transform( fitting a line) is provided and plans for future work include implementation of Hough transforms for fitting circles.

Lab 3  tasks achieved : State of the art Image segmentation techniques such as K-means clustering  and Mean shift algorithm was implemented and tested for various values. Techniques that take Spatiality into account such as normalized cut was also implemented along with general graph cuts (Expectation- Maximization).Several experiments were performed.Advantages and Disadvantages of various techniques are briefly summerised at the end of the report.
